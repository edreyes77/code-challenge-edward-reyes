# Code Challenge for Edward Reyes

Hi Edward, welcome to **Eog Resources** Code Challenge!!!

## Code Challenge Rules
- **15 minutes before the code challenge**: you will receive an email which allows you to access to this repo. You will have 15 minutes to read through instruction and be ready for the challenge.
- You will have **2 hours** to finish code challenge on _your machine_.
- **15 munites after the code challenge**: you will have to **commit code** to this repo so we can evaluate your skillset.

_**Warning:**_ any commit/modification after allowed time will be considered as not-finish.

## Requirements
- Create an WPF application with your own UI (i.e.: buttons, text-boxes, etc) to implement/simulate the game below.
- No code behind is allowed, you have to use binding to control UI.
- It's recommended that you should use `Interface`, `OOP`, and advanced `C#` syntax `7` or `8`

## "Left Center Right" (LCR)

"Left Center Right" (LCR) is a simple dice game for which you are to write a simulation program. LCR uses three specially marked dice and three chips per player. The six-sided dice are marked with the following letters, each on one side of the dice L, C, and R. The other 3 sides of each dice are marked with a dot.

The first player rolls three dice. She passes a chip either to the left, to the right, or to the center pot, depending on the roll of the dice. If any dots are rolled, the player retains her chip for that die. The next player then rolls 3 dice, one die for each chip she possesses, up to three chips. This player then passes chips as directed by the roll. If she should have less than three chips, she only rolls as many dice as he has chips. If she has no chips, she is not out of the game. She simply does NOT roll. Should the person to either side of her be required to pass her a chip, then she again has a chance to win the game and must roll again when her turn comes around.

Turns to roll the dice pass in this manner around and around the table until only one player has chips. The last person having chips wins the game. She is not required to roll the dice.

The simulator input is the number of people playing, which must be three or more, and the number of games to simulate.  The simulator output is, by number of turns, the shortest length game, longest length game, and average length game.
- 3 players x 100 games
- 4 players x 100 games 
- 5 players x 100 games
- 5 players x 1,000 games
- 5 players x 10,000 games
- 5 players x 100,000 games
- 6 players x 100 games
- 7 players x 100 games

**GOOD LUCK!!**
